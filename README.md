# Audio_Mood_Visualizer
Our graduation project targets visualizing emotions' domain. "Audio-Mood Visualizer" is an application that detects emotions from voice and visualizes these emotions through an avatar can be used in many fields. It can be used in the medical field for therapy, where it can help people who have social phobias to communicate easily with others. In games, it can deliver a virtual reflection of a playerâ€™s emotions while protecting their privacy. Such an application can also be beneficial in customer service where it can aid the call center workers in quickly recognizing the emotions of the calling customers. It can also be useful in E-learning and virtual meetings as it can help the teachers to detect the state of the students throughout the sessions. In addition, it also supports privacy as you can use a photo that isn't yours or by using a default avatar.

## Objectives
1- Apply recent advances in speech emotion recognition research.<br>
2- Visualize the recognized emotions (Happy, Sad, Fearful, Calm, Angry) through the generation of avatars with facial expressions that correspond to the detected emotion.<br>
3- Create an application where the user could communicate with people and all his/her emotions are delivered to them through an avatar without needing to open the camera.<br>

## Main Modules/Functionalities
1- Preprocessing.<br>
2- Audio Segmentation.<br> 
3- Feature Extraction.<br>
4- Speech Emotion Recognition.<br>
5- Avatar Generation.<br>

## Dataset:
### RAVDESS Dataset
* 1440 audio file  recorded With  24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male).<br>
* Speech emotions include (calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful,  surprise, neutral and disgust) expressions.<br>
* Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.<br>

## Models:
1- LSTM     accuracy -> 82%
2- CNN and Multihead-transformer   accuracy -> 95%
